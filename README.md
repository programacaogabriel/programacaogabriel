<h2>Hi, I'm Gabriel!👋</h2> 


I really like technology and a way that they connect and go together. 
Despite having a love for Java I always love to learn new technologies, always trying not to loot everything I see. I am dedicating my time to reading books and studying whenever I can so trying to keep myself updated.

What made me enter this world was the creation of a gift, a website for my wife.
This motivates me and introduces the Front End and now I also study BackEnd.
Knowing a little of each, now everything is clearer and so I want to become a FullStack



🎮 To relax, play a video game over the weekend.🎮
